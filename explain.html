      <p>Marlboro High School is gearing up for a frightfully fun event with its annual Trunk or Treat, hosted by the Peer Leaders. Scheduled for October 29th from 4:00 to 5:30 p.m. in the high school parking lot, this event is perfect for children aged 12 and under to show off their Halloween costumes and enjoy a festive evening. Over 30 creatively decorated car trunks will be on display, each filled with candy and treats, ensuring a safe and exciting trick-or-treating experience. The atmosphere promises to be filled with Halloween cheer, colorful costumes, and smiling faces as the community comes together for some spooky fun.

        This family-friendly event is designed with safety and inclusivity in mind. The Trunk or Treat is a nut-free celebration, so families with food allergies can participate without worry. Plus, the event encourages everyone to wear a Halloween costume, adding to the festive spirit. From witches and superheroes to pumpkins and ghosts, participants can enjoy the wide variety of costumes, making it a perfect opportunity for kids to get creative. If the weather doesn't cooperate, a rain date is set for October 30th, so the fun is sure to go on!
        
        In addition to trick-or-treating, snacks and refreshments will be available for purchase, with all proceeds benefiting the American Cancer Society. By attending, families will not only enjoy a memorable Halloween experience but also contribute to an important cause. The event is a wonderful way for the community to support both local initiatives and larger charitable efforts, making it a rewarding and meaningful outing for everyone involved. Donâ€™t miss out on this fun-filled event, where costumes, candy, and community come together for a great cause!
